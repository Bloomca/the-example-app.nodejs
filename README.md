# The node.js example app

This is a fork of [the example app in Node.js](https://github.com/contentful/the-example-app.nodejs).

However, this project is aimed only to one thing â€“ integrate with [contentful-wizard](https://github.com/Bloomca/contentful-wizard), which allows you to add interactive tooltips to all contentful-powered blocks.
